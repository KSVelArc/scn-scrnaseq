    "The Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the circadian pacemaker in mammals. It is located in the ventral hypothalamus and synchronizes by sunlight. Our understanding of the cell types active in the SCN and their function is limited. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) techniques can be used to answer questions about the identity of these cell types and their role in circadian expression.  \n",
